# Physarum Slime Simulation


## Background:

Physarum Polysephalum is a type of slime mold that specializes in growth, movement and area reduction. Due to these characteristics, this slime mold is efficient at finding the shortest path between any amount of given points.

## Slime Simulation

The above described behaviour can be replicated by simulating a large number of particles which follow the same movement principles as Physarum Polycephalum. To efficiently simulate over 500000 slime particles, GPGPU (AMP in C++) was used.
